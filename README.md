# Covid-19-Analysis-using-R
This project was done in a group of 3 people and we have had 6 modules stating the cause of covid-19. 

This is the project that focuses on the cumulative confirmed cases throughout the world vs China. The technology and techniques in this project are not new but by this specific project we will be able to help the Analyst and various other responsible to compare the data in the form of visualizations and graphical presentation. As in this Pandemic Situation it is not that easy for all to understand the tabular format and structured Big Data easily. So, by this project we have prepared a few modules that will help anyone and everyone understand the impact of covid-19 cases throughout the world as well as India.
